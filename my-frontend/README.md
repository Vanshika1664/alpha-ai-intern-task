This app uses localStorage to cache the task list and reduce redundant API calls. On load, the app first checks localStorage for tasks. If present, it uses them. If not, it fetches from the Flask backend and stores them. When tasks are added or deleted, the change is reflected both in the backend and localStorage to keep data in sync. This improves performance and responsiveness, especially on repeated page loads.
